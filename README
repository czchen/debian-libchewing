libchewing - The intelligent phonetic input method library
  http://chewing.csie.net/

[-] History

libchewing is derived from Chewing input method, a xcin module
focusing on intelligent phonetic processing by Lu-chuan Kung
(lckung) and Kang-pen Chen (kpchen). However, the original
authors of Chewing dropped its development, and Chewing was
highly bonded with xcin, which prevents from wider applications.


[-] Motivation

Jim Huang started to separate core algorithm and logic layer
of Chewing since 2002, and he integrated his efforts into a
Chinese terminal named JMCCE as a part of its input method
modules. Also, he attempts to let more applications adapt his
efforts, so that new contributors created (New) Chewing Project
as the infrastructure with writing new bridges among JMCCE,
XCIN, IIIMF, SCIM, OpenVanilla, MS-IME, etc.
